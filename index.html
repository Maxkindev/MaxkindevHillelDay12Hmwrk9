                    The iPhone 5C lacks several major new features introduced in the iPhone 5S;
                    the 5C uses the A6 chip instead of the A7 with motion co-processor, does not
                    include Touch ID, does not support OpenGL ES 3.0, and lacked the Burst iSight
                    camera mode and slow-motion video recording mode. Instead, the iPhone 5C uses
                    much of the same internal hardware of its predecessor, the iPhone 5. However
                    the iPhone 5C uses a hard-coated polycarbonate casing (eschewing the aluminum
                    used by the iPhone 5), along with a standard black glass front (instead of a
                    white glass front offered on silver and gold iPhone models). Similar to the
                    fifth generation iPod Touch models, the iPhone 5C was available in five
                    colors: blue, green, pink, yellow, and white. It was also the first Apple device
                    to ship with iOS 7, which introduced a revamped visual appearance and other
                    new features. It is also the last iPhone to include the familiar "squircle" icon
                    on the Home button.

                        other Apple devices such as the iPod Touch (September 2007), iPad (January 2010), 
                        iPad Mini (November 2012) and second-generation Apple TV onward (September 2010). 
                        As of January 2015, Apple's App Store contained more than 1.4 million iOS 
                        applications, 725,000 of which are native for iPads.[8] These mobile apps 
                        have collectively been downloaded more than 100 billion times.[9]
